## 🎯 North Star

**Become the de-facto open-source AI-Native ITSM for enterprises that need
ServiceNow-class workflows without the lock-in or the footprint.**

Concretely that means:
1. **Process parity** with the ITIL v4 core (already at ~95% with v1.0 GA).
2. **AI that earns its seat** — classification, summarization, RAG, and
   impact analysis that are measurable, not vibes.
3. **Native integration surface** — Feishu / DingTalk / WeCom / Webhook
   ship as first-class connectors, not bolt-ons.
4. **Operational discipline** — coverage, observability, security, and
   release hygiene as defaults, not afterthoughts.

## 🟢 v1.0 GA — Shipped (2026-Q2)

**Theme:** Get the foundation right.

### Capability

- [x] **ITIL core flows** — ticket / incident / problem / change / release / service request
- [x] **Service catalog** — request templates, approval routing, SLA binding
- [x] **BPMN workflow engine** — process definitions, instances, user tasks,
      variable persistence, candidateGroups-driven approval (replaces the
      old dual-track approval system)
- [x] **CMDB v1** — CI types, configurations items, relationships, impact
      analysis, cloud discovery scaffold
- [x] **Knowledge base** — articles, versioning, RAG retrieval
- [x] **SLA** — multi-level policies, escalation matrix, alert rules
- [x] **AI capabilities (scaffold)** — Guidance-Harness-Skill framework,
      LLM Gateway, Triage / Summarize / KB skills
- [x] **RBAC + multi-tenant** — roles, permissions, menu gating, MSP mode
- [x] **Deployment** — Docker Compose (private / saas / saas_msp), GHCR
      images, multi-platform Release zip

### Quality

- [x] GA gate (4 checks): backend tests, frontend build, compose health,
      E2E smoke (11 core APIs)
- [x] Staticcheck + gofumpt + ESLint + tsc
- [x] Dependabot weekly scans
- [x] Security policy + Code of Conduct

### Debt that lands in v1.1

- 🟡 Backend coverage 2% → 40%
- 🟡 Backend controller files > 25k LOC need splitting
- 🟡 Ent schema `.bak` cleanup (handled in v1.0.x hotfix)
- 🟡 Connector marketplace: only Feishu/DingTalk/WeCom/Webhook stubs

---

## 🟡 v1.1 — In Progress (2026-Q3)

**Theme:** Cover the seams and harden the foundation.

### Engineering

- [ ] **Coverage backfill sprint** — bring `service/*` and `controller/*`
      packages from 2% → **40%** overall, focusing on ticket / incident /
      change / approval / auth (the user-facing critical paths)
- [ ] **Controller split** — break up `incident_controller.go` (45k),
      `ticket_controller.go` (27k), `cmdb_controller.go` (28k),
      `bpmn_workflow_controller.go` (30k) into feature-scoped sub-controllers
- [ ] **Integration test suite** — RBAC cross-tenant, BPMN happy paths,
      CMDB impact analysis, SLA escalation. Lives at `itsm-backend/tests/integration/`.
- [ ] **itsm-cli / itsm-skill / itsm-agent** in CI (path-scoped workflows
      + coverage)

### Product

- [ ] **Connector marketplace v1** — Feishu (IM + Approval), DingTalk
      (IM + Work Notice), WeCom (IM), Webhook. Lifecycles via
      `/api/v1/connectors/lifecycle`.
- [ ] **AI Audit console** — review every AI suggestion, accept/reject,
      feed back to evaluator.
- [ ] **Standard change templates** — pre-baked change templates for
      common ops (network, OS patch, DB migration).

### Quality

- [ ] **Incremental coverage gate** (60% on new/modified lines) — already
      landed via `coverage-diff.yml`.
- [ ] **Dependabot auto-merge** — patch-level updates auto-merge after
      green CI (handled in v1.0.x hotfix).

---

## 🟢 v1.5 — Planned (2026-Q4)

**Theme:** AI earns its seat, integrations go live.

### Engineering

- [ ] **AI Evaluator v1** — classification accuracy ≥85%, summarization
      ROUGE ≥0.6, RAG hit-rate ≥70%. Regression suite in CI.
- [ ] **AI telemetry** — capture prompt/response/cost/latency for every
      skill invocation; dashboard at `/api/v1/ai/audit`.
- [ ] **Knowledge base RAG v2** — chunking strategy improvements,
      re-ranking, hybrid search (BM25 + vector).
- [ ] **Skill registry v1** — declarative skill manifests, hot-pluggable
      pipeline, registry UI.

### Product

- [ ] **Feishu / DingTalk / WeCom native connectors** — end-to-end:
      account / approval / IM notification / webhook relay.
- [ ] **Auto-triage (human-in-the-loop)** — AI suggests category,
      assignee, SLA tier; engineer accepts with one click.
- [ ] **SLA forecast skill** — predict SLA breach risk per ticket,
      surface on dashboards.

### Quality

- [ ] **Backend coverage** 40% → **55%** overall.
- [ ] **Performance budgets** — k6 baselines for top 10 endpoints,
      enforced in CI.
- [ ] **Trivy + govulncheck** — daily scans, high-severity blockers.

---

## 🔵 v2.0 — Roadmap (2027-Q2)

**Theme:** MSP-friendly, AI-assisted, multi-region.

### Engineering

- [ ] **Coverage 55% → 70%**.
- [ ] **Service decomposition** — split monolithic `itsm-backend` into
      `core` + `workflow` + `ai` + `cmdb` services along bounded contexts.
- [ ] **Event-driven architecture** — Watermill is already in deps;
      promote to first-class pub/sub for incident events.
- [ ] **Multi-region active-active** — Redis Streams + region-aware
      routing.

### Product

- [ ] **MSP billing** — usage metering, invoicing, allocation reports.
- [ ] **AI auto-triage (full)** — replaces the human-in-the-loop step
      from v1.5 with confidence-based auto-accept.
- [ ] **Impact analysis skill** — given a change, predict affected CIs,
      tickets, and downstream SLAs.
- [ ] **Plugin marketplace v2** — signed plugins, sandboxed execution,
      revenue share for authors.

### Quality

- [ ] **SOC 2 Type II readiness** — control mapping, evidence collection,
      audit-ready logging.
- [ ] **Customer-managed keys (BYOK)** for LLM Gateway.

---

## ⚪ v3.0 — Parked (2027-Q4)

**Theme:** Self-hostable AI, agent ecosystem.

- Self-hostable LLM inference (Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp) — drop the
  external OpenAI dependency for privacy-sensitive deployments.
- Agent marketplace — third-party agents that can act on the ITSM
  data model under strict RBAC.
- Mobile PWA with offline-first ticket intake.
- Multilingual UI (zh-CN baseline; en-US, ja-JP, ko-KR planned).

---
