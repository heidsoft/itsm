## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.2] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **SLA Compliance Statistics** - Fixed negative compliance numbers caused by mismatched time scopes between total ticket count (30 days) and violated ticket count (all time). Backend now uses `HasTicketWith` edge predicate for consistent scope.
- **Timezone Inconsistency** - Fixed dashboard activity timestamps using `time.RFC3339` format instead of `Format("2006-01-02 15:04:05")` which browsers parse as UTC.
- **TicketDetail Duplicate Request** - Fixed double API call on ticket detail page by removing `fetchTicket`/`fetchSLAInfo` from useEffect dependency arrays.
- **Login Error Message** - Login page now shows actual backend error messages (e.g., "invalid credentials") instead of generic "登录失败".

### Changed

- **Ant Design TabPane Deprecation Migrated** - Converted all `Tabs.TabPane` / `<TabPane>` usage to `items` prop pattern across 8 files: analytics, applications, NotificationCenter, TicketTypeFormModal, IncidentManagement, FieldDesigner, profile, dashboard.
- **Space direction → orientation** - Migrated 6 instances of deprecated `Space direction="vertical"` to `orientation="vertical"`.
- **destroyOnClose → destroyOnHidden** - Migrated 1 instance in ApprovalTimeline component.
- **alert()/confirm() → antd message/modal** - Replaced native browser dialogs in marketplace and installations pages with antd `App.useApp()` message/modal.
- **console.log Cleanup** - Removed debug console.log from TicketDetail and BPMNDesigner.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **Connector/Skill Manifest Hardening** - All official connector manifests now declare `version`, `requiredPermissions`, and a deterministic SHA-256 `checksum`; registration is fail-closed (incomplete manifests are rejected at startup). Skill manifests share the same validation and checksum convention. Market API exposes `isOfficial` / `requiredPermissions` / `checksum`.
- **Post-Schema Migrations 008-010** - Initialization ledger (008), PostgreSQL RLS tenant isolation (009), ticket types in `itil-core` transaction (010).
- **Bootstrap Token** - One-time hashed bootstrap token with TTL, concurrent-consumption protection, replay defense, and break-glass flow for first-admin creation.
- **Endpoint ACL Manifest** - Versioned ACL manifest with 100% static coverage gate over protected routes (route-ACL-permission-menu).
- **Fencing Token Hardening** - Owner/token/lease re-verified inside the committing transaction; stale-writer prevention proven via PostgreSQL fault-injection tests.
- **Audit Routes** - New audit trail API endpoints with tenant isolation support
- **CI Attribute Validator** - Moved from handlers to service layer for better separation of concerns
- **Operator Context** - Enhanced audit trail with operator context tracking

### Fixed

- **Ant Design v6 Select Compatibility** - Replaced deprecated `<Select><Option>` child pattern with `options` prop across 100+ files. Fixes issue where clicking Select dropdowns had no response in antd v6. Affected modules: Ticket, Incident, Problem, Change, CMDB, Workflow, SLA, Service Catalog, Admin, and Reports pages.

### Changed

- **CMDB API Route Convergence** - `/api/v1/cmdb/*` is now the canonical prefix for all CMDB endpoints (CIs, CI types, relationships, relationship types, topology, impact analysis, change history, stats). Frontend API clients (`cmdb-api.ts`, `cmdb-relationship.ts`) have been switched to the canonical prefix. Added `GET /api/v1/cmdb/relationship-types` to the canonical tree. Note: change history is `GET /api/v1/cmdb/cis/:id/history` (the old `change-history` suffix only exists on the deprecated alias).
- **CMDB Multi-Tenant Isolation** - Added `tenant_id` field to CI relationships, configuration item history, and discovery sources. Added tenant-aware backfill migration.
- **CI Attribute Validation** - Migrated from `handlers/cmdb/attribute_validation.go` to `service/ci_attribute_validator.go`.

### Deprecated

- **`/api/v1/configuration-items/*` routes** - Kept as a compatibility alias for clients not yet upgraded. No new endpoints will be added under this prefix; removal will be evaluated after a regression period.

### Migration Notes

- **CMDB tenant backfill**: Run `itsm-backend/migrations/20260610_cmdb_tenant_id_backfill.sql` on existing databases to populate the new `tenant_id` fields.
- **Preset CI types**: Enable with `itsm-backend/migrations/20260611_enable_preset_ci_types.sql`.
- **Audit routes**: New endpoints are protected by existing JWT + RBAC + tenant middleware.
